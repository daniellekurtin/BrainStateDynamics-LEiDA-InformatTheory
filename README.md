# BrainStateDynamics-LEiDA-InformatTheory
A repository with software to compute brain states and metrics of their state dynamics



This repository contains the software used to
<ol>
<li> format extracted timeseries for use in Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis (LEiDA) </li>
<li> run LEiDA </li> 
<li> compute six metrics of state dynamics </li> 
<li> evaluate the effects of task on the state dynamic metrics </li> 
<li> evaluate whether there is a relationship between state dynamic metrics and fluid intelligence. </li> 
</ol>

Scripts to run these processes locally are in the RunLocally folder, whereas RunBatch_Depreceated contains scripts to run everything as a batch job on a high performance cluster. The folder is Depreceated because the most up-t0-date implementation of this pipeline is in the RunLocally folder. Each folder has a README file explaining the scripts and the order they should be run.
