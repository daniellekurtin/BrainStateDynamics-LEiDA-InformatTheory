# BrainStateDynamics-LEiDA-InformatTheory
A repository with software to compute brain states and metrics of their state dynamics



This repository contains the software used to (1) format extracted timeseries for use in Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis (LEiDA), (2) run LEiDA, (3) compute six metrics of state dynamics, (4) evaluate the effects of task on the state dynamic metrics, (5) evaluate whether there is a relationship between state dynamic metrics and fluid intelligence. 

Scripts to run these processes locally are in the RunLocally folder, whereas RunBatch_Depreceated contains scripts to run everything as a batch job on a high performance cluster. Each folder has a README file explaining the scripts and the order they should be run. 

Questions can be posted as Issues in this repo, or please email d.kurtin@surrey.ac.uk
