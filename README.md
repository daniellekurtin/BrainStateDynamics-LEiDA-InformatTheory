# BrainStateDynamics-LEiDA-InformatTheory

This repository contains the software used to . . 
<ol>
<li> Format extracted timeseries for use in Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis (LEiDA) [1] </li>
<li> Run LEiDA </li> 
<li> Compute the following six metrics of state dynamics: </li> 
  <ol>
  <li> State lifetime </li>
  <li> State probability </li>
  <li> Directed transitions among brain states </li>
  <li> Lempel Ziv Complexity of state timeseries </li>
  <li> Block Decomposition Methods of Complexity of state timeseries </li>
  <li> 0-4th order transition </li>
  </ol>
<li> Evaluate the effects of task on the state dynamic metrics </li> 
<li> Evaluate whether there is a relationship between state dynamic metrics and fluid intelligence. </li> 
</ol>

Scripts to run these processes locally are in the RunLocally folder, whereas RunBatch_Depreceated contains scripts to run everything as a batch job on a high performance cluster. The folder is Depreceated because the most up-to-date implementation of this pipeline is in the RunLocally folder. Each folder has a README file explaining the scripts and the order they should be run. 

This pipeline utilizes data from 187 subjects downloaded from the freely available Human Connectome Project's preprocessed Wu-Minn 1200 healthy young adult dataset [2]. Each subject performed the Working Memory, Relation, Language, and Emotion task. Timeseries of task activity was extracted from each region of the AAL2 atlas, and used in this pipeline.
